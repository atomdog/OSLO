Once there was a tree And she loved little boy. And every day the boy would come
And he would gather her leaves And make them into crowns and play king of the forest.
He would climb up her trunk And swing from her branches And when he was tired.he
would sleep in her shade.
And the boy loved the tree Very much. And the tree was happy.
But time went by, And the boy grew older. And the tree was often alone. Then one day the boy came to the tree and the tree said: come, boy, come and climb up my trunk and swing from my branches and eat apples and play in 
my shade and be happy.
