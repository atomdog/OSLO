The open source loop operator project is an effort to produce an open source virtual assistant framework that runs only on your machine, and keeps your data that way too
## Getting things running

- the [wiki](https://github.com/atomdog/oslo/wiki/Spinning-things-up) guide on getting started
## Development
- [developer notes](devnotes.md) contains bi-weekly informal entries on progress
- the [jira](https://buspark.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/OSLO/boards/25/roadmap) has a more formal log
