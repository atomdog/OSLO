## Thursday, March 24, 2022

### Known tasks
- [ ] Fix [clustering](clusterResolve.py) strange behavior
     - Clustering inconsistencies, errors
- [ ] Extensive documentation
     - Code is cryptic, esoteric, and generally confusing in both appearance and function.
     - Draft a getting started page.
- [ ] Finalize live node system
     - Tying changing information (like the current time) to static nodes for quick reference by the [semweb](semweblib.py) 
- [ ] Data flows 
     -Data must flow upwards from [textflow](textflow.py) for communication between loops
     -Connect the [language loop](languageloop.py) to the [causal model](causal_model.py)
     -Reconnect the speaker-id to [textflow](textflow.py) and update the semantic web to accept it again
- [ ] Forgetfulness 
     - [Semantic web](semweblib.py) needs to forget conflicting facts to improve accuracy and time efficiency 
     - Dependent on completion of root representation.
- [ ] Runtime
     - Call each loop from a main one.
 - [ ] Deployment
      - Update github 
### Recent progress
- Located and removed bug in [clusterResolve](clusterResolve.py)
- Improved Wyze integrations 
- Began root representation format
- Optimized audio loop
