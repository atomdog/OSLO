body = '''Over the past 15 years, antidepressant use has increased in
the United States by nearly 65% (Products—Data Briefs,
2017). From 2017 to 2018, 19% of adults in the United
States experienced a mental illness—an increase of 1.5 million people when compared to the previous year (State & of
Mental Health in America, 2021). These do not include the
increases in distress after COVID-19, which has resulted in
heightened rates of moderate to severe depression, anxiety,
and suicidal ideation (Shade, 2021). Additionally, life expectancy, which has increased yearly since 1918, has decreased
over the past several years in the United States due to dramatic rises in deaths from suicide, alcoholism, and drug
overdoses (Case & Deaton, 2020). Over the past decade, several economists, journalists, sociologists, and mental health
practitioners have posited that the increases in mental illness
and distress are due to neoliberal economic policies and
ideologies. In his book The Selfsh Capitalist, psychologist
Oliver James found that twice as many people sufer from
emotional distress in the English-speaking nations that have
adapted neoliberal capitalist policies when compared to people in the Western European nations which did not (James,
2008). He also notes the rapid increase in emotional distress
in the United States since the 1980s when the country began
to implement neoliberal policies such as eliminating restrictions on the trade market and cutting social services (James,
2008). Economic policies such as deregulation of industry
and decreased public sector spending starting in the 1980s
have spawned wealth inequality, mass incarceration, and job
insecurity, which all can contribute to emotional distress
(Case & Deaton, 2020; Wilkinson & Pickett, 2011). Additionally, economic and social policies created a change in
ideology favoring individualism, materialism, and competitiveness, which are not compatible with human needs such
as social connection and community, leading to anxiety and
depression (James, 2008). Furthermore, through poor access

to mental healthcare due to the for proft healthcare system
and the medicalization of emotional distress due to the rise
of biological psychiatry, how we treat mental illness in the
United States has also contributed to rising rates of anxiety and depression (Case & Deaton, 2020; Cohen, 2017).
This article will explain the economic and social tenets of
neoliberalism and how they exacerbate emotional distress.
Additionally, this article will discuss how neoliberalism has
afected the mental healthcare system further contributing to
the rise in mental illness. Lastly, there will be a discussion
about how we, as mental health providers, can advocate for
systemic change.
Neoliberalism
For the purposes of this discussion, neoliberalism refers
to the economic theory that human well-being can be
enhanced by individual entrepreneurship and that the government’s responsibility is to create an institutional framework that allows for it  (Harvey, 2005). Markets are seen as
optimal structures and the assumption is that if they were
allowed to function without restraint, they would be able
to serve all economic needs and generate full employment
for all those who wish to work (Harvey, 2005). From this
point of view, it is essential to eliminate restrictions on
markets by decreasing the strength of unions, privatizing
state enterprises, and opening domestic markets to foreign
capital and goods  (Shaikh, 2014). These policies deviated from the Keynesian economic policy in place after
the Second World War that focused on full employment
and the welfare of its citizens and used the State’s power
to intervene in market processes to achieve this (Harvey,
2005). Corporate activities were highly regulated and
working class institutions were infuential within the state
apparatus (Harvey, 2005). By the end of the 1960s the
economy was in turmoil while unemployment and infation soared (Harvey, 2005). Neoliberalism became popular
in order to solve this economic crisis (Harvey, 2005). In
his book, A Brief History of Neoliberalism, David Harvey argues that the upper class supported these policies
in order to further their own power and infuence because
they felt threatened by the decrease in their share in the
national income (Harvey, 2005). Neoliberal policies
were broadly enacted through the Reagan administration
with corporate tax breaks and incentives, deregulation of
business, and the introduction of working practices that
strongly favor employers over unions (Harvey, 2005). This
was accompanied by transferring resources from public to
private ownership and contracting out services that were
once provided by the public sector (Moncrief, 2001). The
state also drastically reduced public sector spending and
eliminated social programs (Moncrief, 2001). Trade liberalization and deregulation of foreign fnancial investment
led to increased volume of trade which demanded high
rates of consumption and also provided sources of cheap
labor abroad putting downward pressure on wages in the
US (Moncrief, 2001). Although Neoliberal policies were
billed as attempts to enhance individual freedoms, forms
of surveillance and policing became a key strategy to deal
with social problems when social services were minimized
(Harvey, 2005). This worked to maintain social order as
well as uphold private property and corporate interests
(Harvey, 2005). Neoliberalization has not been successful at increasing capital accumulation with the exception
of the economic elite (Harvey, 2005). These policies have
also led to staggering income inequality, disempowerment
of workers in their ability to advocate for themselves, outsourcing of manufacturing jobs overseas, inadequate social
services, mass incarceration and a healthcare system that
is not only expensive but inefective in providing for its
citizens (Case & Deaton, 2020; Nkansah-Amankra et al.,
2013). With these policies came increased inequality as
the wages of the top 1% of earners grew by 160.3% from
1979–2019 while wages for the working class have either
decreased or remained the same (Mishel & Kandra, 2020).
Working conditions have also sufered due to the decreased
power of unions which has led to longer hours, increased
work intensity, and less worker control of how and where
work is performed (Moncrief, 2001). Through deregulation, the free market became a vehicle for consolidation of
power allowing corporations to exercise control over large
segments of the economy giving them the power to infuence the political process and protect their interests (Harvey, 2005). Neoliberalism is not confned to economics
but also represents the evaluative social order in which the
merits of human actions are assessed by their market value
(Davies, 2017). Constant messages about benefts of the
commercialization of more aspects of life and increases
in trade helped to make consumerism more popular and
spread the message that fulfllment can be obtained from
material afuence (Moncrief, 2001). Competitiveness
was also encouraged not just through consumerism, but
also as a virtue of individualism (Moncrief, 2001). There
was a shift from an acceptance of collective virtues to
individualism and self-reliance (Moncrief, 2001). Faith in
the free market to provide for everyone assumed that the
people who were not successful were unsuccessful due to
their own faults and not willing to work hard enough to
achieve success (Davies, 2017). Ideologically, neoliberal
capitalism sees competition as a defning characteristic of
human nature, that citizens are able to exercise democratic
choices and maximize their quality of life by purchasing,
and that the market rewards merit so the rich are seen as Neoliberal Policy and Mental Illness
As stated above, neoliberal capitalism has led to an increase
in inequality and worsened working conditions. Although
cost of living increased, wages have remained stagnant
requiring minimum wage workers to work more hours
to cover their living expenses (Mishel & Kandra, 2020).
Decreased funding for social programs and welfare reform
has also contributed to increased diagnosis of mental illness
as traditional welfare programs have shifted to only provide for people with medical or psychiatric illness (Hansen
et al., 2014). These outcomes themselves have been shown
to cause distress likely contributing to increased rates of
mental illness, substance abuse, and suicide.
In recent years there has been an increased focus on social
determinants of health and widespread acceptance that there
are strong associations between poverty and mental illness
(Allen et al., 2014). The World Health Organization’s 2014
report Social Determinants of Mental Health showed that
common mental disorders such as anxiety and depression
are distributed along an economic gradient (Allen et al.,
2014). The report suggests that people with lower socioeconomic status are more likely to be exposed to adverse
childhood experiences increasing the likelihood of mental
illness (Allen et al., 2014). This is one potential explanation for rising rates of mental illness as a consequence of
increased poverty or “near poverty” from wage stagnation and fewer welfare programs (Cohen, 2017; NkansahAmankra et al., 2013). However, in their book The Spirit
Level, Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett show that inequality also seems to have a large impact on mental health
for everyone regardless of social class (Wilkinson & Pickett,
2011). These researchers compared rates of mental illness in
countries with higher income inequality such as the United
States to countries with lower income inequality such as
Japan and found a more than threefold diference in rates of
mental illness and a stronger tendency toward drug use in
less egalitarian countries (Wilkinson & Pickett, 2011). They
believe that a larger diference in income inequality leads
to increased importance of social status heightening status
competition and causing increased rates of chronic stress
(Wilkinson & Pickett, 2011).
Other recent developments that can be attributed as phenomena of neoliberal capitalism, such as the loss of meaningful work and worsening job opportunities for workingclass people, may contribute to increasing rates of mental
illness (Hari, 2019). People in the US are working longer
hours and are increasingly unsatisfed with their jobs (Hari,
2019). In their recent book Deaths of Despair and the
Future of Capitalism, economists Anne Case and Angus
Deaton track recent corporate and government practices
that efect the working class, which they believe have led
to the increased death rates from suicide, drug overdose
and alcoholic cirrhosis since 1999. These combined rates
were much higher in working-class white people without
a college degree (Case & Deaton, 2020). Workers without
secondary education face short-term jobs with high turnover, with many dropping out of the workforce entirely (Case
& Deaton, 2020). With blue-collar labor replaced by cheap
foreign alternatives, manufacturing jobs can no longer ofer
the stability or opportunities for advancement enjoyed by
previous generations, (Case & Deaton, 2020). Furthermore,
jobs that are available to those without college degrees are
service jobs often outsourced to stafng frms that don’t provide workers with adequate benefts, long term contracts,
or opportunity for promotion (Case & Deaton, 2020). Outsourced labor and increasingly popular gig work do not
provide workers with the stability, social cohesion, and
meaning that were once provided by direct employment by
companies and manufacturing jobs (Case & Deaton, 2020).
Through interviewing and tracking health outcomes of British civil servants, psychiatrist Michael Marmot found that
lower level civil servants had an increased risk of psychiatric
illness largely due to having little control over their work
and feeling a lack of balance between eforts and rewards
(Stansfeld et al., 1999). With less control of their work and
fewer opportunities for recognition and promotion, workers
often derive less meaning in work, which causes increased
anxiety and depression, and thereby fuels rising deaths and
substance abuse among white working class men (Case &
Deaton, 2020; Hari, 2019). It is difcult for the less-educated
workforce to escape this situation as intergenerational social
mobility has decreased signifcantly as well (Wilkinson &
Pickett, 2011).
In 1996, President Clinton signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act putting stricter requirements on traditional welfare such as a fve-year limit for
benefts, stricter eligibility, and work participation requirements (Hansen et al., 2014). Changing these policies did not
decrease the need for fnancial support, so the many of the
people who needed assistance applied for Social Security
income (SSI) instead (Hansen et al., 2014). This can be seen
through the dramatic increases in Social Security recipients
since 1996 which reached a 50–100% growth in the number
of young adult benefciaries by 2000 (Hansen et al., 2014).
However, these benefts can only be received with a medical
or psychiatric diagnosis, with psychiatric diagnosis being
the largest diagnostic category (Hansen et al., 2014). This
is also likely a signifcant driver for the increase in mental
illness diagnoses and medication consumption as taking
psychiatric medication is frequently required for receiving SSI benefts (Hansen et al., 2014). This may also lead

providers to medicalize distress due to the consequences of
poverty in order to give their patients eligibility for fnancial assistance (Hansen et al., 2014). The UK implemented
similar austerity policies in 2013 with their Universal Credit
program which enforced stricter conditions for unemployment benefts (Wickham et al., 2020). Studies have shown an
increase in mental distress among unemployed participants
enrolled in the program by 6.75 percentage points due to
anxieties from the threat of losing essential income due to
minor infringements and pressure to apply for a high volume of jobs (Wickham et al., 2020). Although the US did
not measure similar outcomes regarding mental health with
the changes to welfare policy, studies have shown that these
reforms increased rates of extreme poverty and increased the
number of disconnected unemployed single mothers who
were not receiving any government assistance (Matthews,
2016). Child poverty has also increased after these policies
were enacted (Nkansah-Amankra et al., 2013). Based on
these results, neoliberal eforts to cut spending on social
services increase mental distress and disconnect the most at
risk individuals from the help that they need.
Neoliberal Ideologies Contributing
to Emotional Distress
Neoliberal ideologies, as mentioned above, have also contributed to distress. Neoliberalism encourages individualism,
which has decreased emphasis on the need for community
and social connection for fulfllment. Since individualism is
viewed as a desirable moral characteristic, asking for help,
especially fnancially, is frowned upon. With complete faith
in the free market to provide for all who wish to work, people who do not achieve fnancial success are blamed for
their misfortunes increasing the stigma of poverty. Attitudes
toward people who receive government fnancial assistance
can elicit feelings of shame from those who receive benefts
(Hansen et al., 2014). Neoliberalism also encourages consumerism and when people adopt materialistic values they
are more likely to have symptoms of anxiety and depression with poorer relationships and lower self-esteem (James,
2008). Neoliberal capitalism has also led to mass incarceration and poverty particularly in minority populations (Nkansah-Amankra et al., 2013). Racism and neoliberal ideologies
have justifed the creation of a disposable population who
are viewed as criminals that are unwilling to work (NkansahAmankra et al., 2013). Although it is unclear what is causing
increasing suicide rates in Black adolescents, past injustices
make it difcult for minorities to escape their fnancial situations likely leading to hopelessness and poor mental health
(Sounding the alarm on black youth suicide, n.d.).
Margaret Thatcher famously stated that  there is “no
such thing as society, only individual men and women”
(Nkansah-Amankra et al., 2013). However, strong social
ties and community are benefcial for mental health and
mental disorders are more common among people with
fewer friends and weaker community engagement (Hari,
2019). Involvement in community organizations has fallen
445% between 1985 and 1994, and for many, the immediate family is all that remains as a primary support structure (Hari, 2019). Marriage rates are also declining among
white working class people without a college degree, which
has been attributed to poor economic prospects (Anne &
Angus, 2020). Researchers John and Stephanie Cacioppo
have argued that loneliness is a risk factor for symptoms and
anxiety and depression (Cacioppo et al., 2014). Loneliness
has been described as an epidemic due to dramatic increases
in perceived loneliness since 1980 (Hari, 2019). Union participation was once a source of community for workers, but
decreases in union participation has caused this community
to disappear (Anne & Angus, 2020). Wealth inequality has
also been cited as a cause of increased loneliness as levels
of trust in others has been found to be lower in countries
with greater wealth inequality when compared to countries
with lesser wealth inequality (Wilkinson & Pickett, 2011).
This is likely also due to competitive attitudes toward others
due to ideologies of neoliberal capitalism and competition
for social status (Wilkinson & Pickett, 2011). Social relationships appear to be better in more egalitarian countries
including better social cohesion and trust, involvement in
community life, and lower levels of violence (Wilkinson &
Pickett, 2011).'''
